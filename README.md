How I built the Memory Game
---

* I changed the DOM with JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game.

* Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.

* Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of the game.

* Added moves to the cards when they match and are unmatched.

* Create a pop-up modal when player wins game and when he loses all the stars.
